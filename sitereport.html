                <p>
                    Over the course of this module, I learned the basics of web development,
                    including HTML structure, CSS styling, as well as responsive design techniques.
                    The development of this portfolio taught me how to organize the multi-page website,
                    maintain consistent navigation, and also apply design principles such as  color schemes,
                    typography, and also the layout grids. I also encountered challenges in debugging CSS 
                    alignment issues and ensuirng that the site looked good on desktop
                    as well as mobile devices as well. Through trial and error, I learned the importance of HTML 
                    on how it is used and is used for developing websites in day to day lives. I even grasped the knowledge of it as well.
